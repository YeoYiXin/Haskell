# Haskell
 I have done Caesar Cipher, String Transmitter, Tautology Checker and Voting System to understand the fundamentals of Haskell.
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>In Caesar Cipher, I have learned how to encode message by replacing actual characters with another character and then decode the message. In this project, I have also implemented frequecy analysis for message encoding and decoding.</li>
  <li>In String Transmitter, I have simulated the transmission of a string of characters as a list of bits.</li>
  <li>In Tautology Checker, I have used truth tables to decide if logical propositions are true for all possible values of their variables, i.e. if they are tautologies</li>
  <li>In Voting System, there are two type of system:
      <ul>
       <li>First Past The Post: In this voting system, each person has one vote, and the party with the largest number of votes is the winner</li>
       <li>Alternative Vote: In this voting system, each person can vote for as many or as few parties as they like, listing them in preference order on their ballot paper (first choice, second choice, etc.). The winner is decided by eliminating the party with the smallest number of first preference votes, and then repeat this process until only one party remains. This party is
the winner.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
